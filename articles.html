            <h4> Taylor Swift in Kansas City—Again—to Cheer Travis Kelce on at Chiefs-Bills Game  </h4>
            <p><span> December 11th, 2023 </span> </p>

            <p> Sadly for the angry males in NFL fan-land, billionaire musician Taylor Swift attended her sixth Kansas City Chiefs game Sunday, this one against New York's Buffalo Bills. As with her past stints in the stands, Swift is cheering on boyfriend/Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce from a box in Kansas City's GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. But on this auspicious occasion, she's doing it as Time magazine's vaunted Person of the Year.

It's because of that honor that we now know how she feels about her inclusion in the coverage of NFL games she attends. “I’m just there to support Travis,” she said in an interview with the magazine. “I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.” </p>

<h4> Twitter reacts to slip up as Taylor Swift called Travis Kelce's wife by Tony Romo </h4>
 <p><span> December 10th, 2023 </span> </p>
<p> 
It was an innocent slip of the tongue, but it immediately set the social media world onfire.

During Sunday's Kansas City Chief's game, analyst Tony Romo called Taylor Swift Kelce's "wife."

Jim Nance responded, "You don't know something we don't know, do you?"

The slip up came after Kelce caught a pass on a 3rd and 18 and the camera panned to a shot of Swift cheering in a luxury box.

At the time, the Chiefs were losing to the Buffalo Bills by 14 points as the first half was winding down.

Swift and Kelce have been an item since late summer, with each attending one another's events.

<h4> Taylor Swift to Earn Over $100 Million from Spotify This Year</h4>
<p> <span> December 6th, 2023 </span> </p>
<p>Taylor Swift is finishing the year on a high!

The pop superstar, 33, has been named Spotify’s top-streamed artist of 2023, after achieving 26.1 billion global streams since Jan. 1. And she is also on track to earn over $100 million in royalties on the platform this year, PEOPLE can confirm. 

While Swift hit the top spot on the streaming service, Bad Bunny, The Weeknd, Drake and Mexican star Peso Pluma followed behind her respectively. 

The announcement of the year's top artists was made this week as part of Spotify’s annual Spotify Wrapped, revealing the musical trends of 2023. 

With one more month of the year to go, Swift’s Spotify streams are expected to increase — along with her royalties total on the platform – to an estimated 27.2 billion streams, according to Billboard.

Swift’s earnings across all music streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube will cause the number to rise even more, with publishing revenue increasing the total to nearly $200 million, Billboard reported.</p>

            <h4> Taylor Swift Earns Golden Globes Nomination for Eras Tour Film </h4>
 <p><span> December 11th, 2023 </span> </p>
<p> Karma is a Golden Globes nomination for Taylor Swift!

The music superstar is up for a win at this year’s Golden Globe Awards, as her Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour film is nominated for cinematic and box office achievement.

The category is a new addition for 2024, and also includes nominees Barbie and Oppenheimer, which lead the show’s nominations list with nine and eight nods each, respectively.

Swift will also go up against The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1, John Wick: Chapter 4 and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in the category.

A nearly three-hour spectacle that draws from her 10 albums, the concert film premiered in theaters in October, breaking records for first-day ticket sales and grossing more than $200 million at the global box office. The movie — which will be available for streaming on Dec. 13, Swift’s 34th birthday — also had the biggest concert film debut of all time.
